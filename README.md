# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: inadequate error handling during database operations and when dealing with non-existent resources.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug Description

The original code lacks proper handling for database errors and cases where a requested user is not found. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including:

* **Cryptic error messages:** Users might receive generic error messages (e.g., 'Internal Server Error'), making it difficult to diagnose the problem.
* **Server crashes:** Unhandled exceptions could bring down the entire server.
* **Inconsistent behavior:** The application might behave unexpectedly depending on whether database operations succeed or fail.

## Solution

The solution (`bugSolution.js`) addresses these issues by:

* Implementing proper error handling for database operations.
* Sending appropriate HTTP status codes to inform clients about errors (e.g., 404 Not Found).
* Providing informative error messages to help debugging.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in production applications to ensure reliability and a better user experience.
